                                    Saylani Welfare International Trust has been working for the last 22 years to improve the conditions of the less privileged, helpless, and handicapped individuals. The organization is working day and night to make life happier, especially for the middle class, lower middle class and even lower class. At time of establishing the organization, the founder of Saylani Welfare International Trust and a few of his associates had made a commitment to serve the distressed people living in Pakistan and abroad in all stages of life. It is a blessing in disguise that today the organization is serving humanity in more than 63 areas of life without any discrimination.

Hazrat Allama Maulana Muhammad Bashir Farooq, a distinguished spiritual figure and Islamic scholar, serves as the guiding force, founder, and patron of this organization. Through his dedicated efforts, Saylani Welfare International Trust has become a global humanitarian entity, extending its service to humanity worldwide.

Originating in a rented house, the organization has grown to encompass over 630 branches globally, accompanied by an equal number of Dastarkhwans, employing thousands. Presently, the organization allocates an monthly budget exceeding a billion for humanitarian services. Encompassing more than 63 facets of life from birth to death, including areas such as food, health, education, social welfare, clean water, marriage, mass I.T training, vocational training, aid to Syrian and Burmese refugees, pilgrim services, school fees, easy loans, employment assistance, hairdressing, medical facilities, diagnostic services, x-rays, ultrasounds, ECGs, consultant clinics, mobile dining, mobile clinics, mobile air care clinics, and operation theaters, our organization is dedicated to serving humanity, especially during natural disasters.

Saylani Welfare reaches more than 300,000 individuals daily, offering impactful services. The organization provides vocational training across various disciplines, supports underprivileged families with housing, covers school fees and annual expenses for children, aids in daughters' marriages, facilitates small-scale business through loans, and fosters employment opportunities with rickshaws, motorbikes, stalls, shop delivery, finger chips machines, sewing machines, and other essentials.

                                  <h3> <b> Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over?</b></h3><br>
                                    ( Surat Baqara, Verse 245 )<br>
                                    It should be noted that Allah, who is in need of no one and nothing, instills upon his men to give Qarz-e-Hasana because it is in man’s nature to be frugal whilst spending his wealth. Allah speaks about qarz because it is returned and Allah promises that He will return the goodly loan by 70 folds. Allah conveys his message to the Muslim ummah through the Holy Prophet Muhammad prompting Muslims to spend their wealth in a certain way. He says,Oh children of Adam! Trust me with your wealth. If you do so, no fire, flood or thieves will be able to rob you off your money. Instead, you will be endowed with your wealth when you most need it. He further says that the poor and weak will not remain hungry and naked except due to the negligence of the rich, who should not be stingy in spending their money on those worse off than themselves. Allah will not only take strict accountability from those people but He will also punish them accordingly. On the Day Of Judgement, the rich will be humiliated because they did not help the needy. The needy will complain to Allah and say that all those men on whom you graciously bestowed the rights of wealth showed negligence in its proper use; they were busy spending on themselves and forgot about us, the ones who needed it. Allah will reply to this and say: “I swear on my respect and glory! I will bring you closer to me and push them further away.
                                    Alhamdollilah, Allah has accorded Saylani Welfare with the highest favor by sending those people our way who follow the teachings of the Holy Quran and Hadith, give zakat, fidyah, fitrah, khairat and other donations to help us help those in need. The purpose of sending this message to you is so that you not only spread this message to others but also play your part in helping us to continue serving and helping the needy till the Day of Judgment.
                                    Muhammad Bashir Farooq
